# POC using AWS Ansible Terraform Providers  Jenkins

Here is the POC task:
If you are well versed with automation technologies and its details, you should not take more than 120
minutes to complete this exercise.
1. Create a VPC, use the CIDR of your choice. Also have internet gateway and the required routes
defined
2. Create an auto scaling group
3. Create a web server instance
4. Change the default web server TCP port from 80 to TCP 8080
5. Create a load balancer and point the web server
6. Open TCP port 80 on the security group to allow incoming traffic from the world
7. Create a IAM user and grant him access to only restart web server
Expectations:
• Use Terraform and Ansible to achieve the above
• Above tasks must create the usable environment in one single script.
• You can download and install all the tools required on the computer provided to you.
• Access to AWS or Azure account is with your interview coordinator.
• Nice to have would be a Jenkins job calling this script
